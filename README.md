# Website for a personal Emby Backup Tool - Version "Angular & Angular Material"

This project contains the website for checking the status stored in a personal Emby Server. Please visit the website [emby.media](https://emby.media/) for reading more details about Emby Server. The project uses the Web UI framework of [Angular](https://angular.io/) in conjunction with the [Angular Material Design](https://material.angular.io/).

_Remark_: There is also a [parallel repository](https://github.com/jfandy1982/emby-backup-ui-angular-bootstrap), which tries to achieve the same by using the Bootstrap UI framework instead of the Angular Material Design.

The website uses the REST-based API as implemented in my repository [Emby Backup Backend](https://github.com/jfandy1982/emby-backup-backend).
